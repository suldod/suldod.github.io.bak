Hello back fellow red teamers. I decided to come make a blog post after a little of long period in which I lost all of my other blog posts.

Lately I have been focused on Windows stuff, such as excercises on trying to bypass Windows Defender through trial and errors etc as a practice to help me make some preparations for a possible OSEP attempt lol.

I came across some amazing repos which I though would be worth to explain on a blog.

First let's take a view :

- [https://github.com/TheWover/DInvoke](https://github.com/TheWover/DInvoke)
 
DInvoke is dynamic replacement for PInvoke and contains powerful primitives that can be combined to dynamically invoke unmanaged code from disk or from memory.

You can have this reference for a deeper explaination on what DInvoke does and what it really is : [https://thewover.github.io/Dynamic-Invoke/](https://thewover.github.io/Dynamic-Invoke/)

While desperatly googling about examples of DInvoke being used on an actual Proof of Concept for silent Code Execution I ended up finding this amazing tool which is fully ported on DInvoke APIs : [https://github.com/snovvcrash/DInjector](https://github.com/snovvcrash/DInjector)
